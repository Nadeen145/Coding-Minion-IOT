# Coding Minion
A robotic minion that can scan barcodes, move parallel to the wall, turn 90, 180 degree, blink, sing and dance.


# Goal 
A robotic minion that solves mazes with the help of the user's programming. The minion walks straight, and when it hits a wall or a junction, it turns to the right or left or forward and continues to walk. The direction of rotation is determined according to a program that the user "programs" by arranging colored cards containing barcodes. The entire programming is done before starting the trip by scanning the barcodes. If there is a mistake, the user rearranges the tabs and scans again.
